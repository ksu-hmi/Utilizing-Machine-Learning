# :+1: Project Road Map :+1:

The purpose of the **"Utilizing Machine Learning for Image Recognition"** project is to learn and understand the Python code publicly available from MD.ai and to figure out how the nural network is created, trained, validated, and tested in Google CoLab. The selected "Lesson 1" code from MD.ai utilizes a set of 75 images from their public repository and running training of the nural network on 65 of those images. 8 images are used for validation. The code is written in a way that if the loss cannot be improved upon in two consecutive iterations of the training dataset, the code exits training and testing begins. The program is a great example of machine learning. The images contain a random mixture of chest and abdominal x-rays. The network is trained to recognise and distinguish these images, and does it with around 93% accuracy. I have run the full code numerous times and never achieved more than 94% accuracy with 0.017 loss. The results of the program display two test images and shows if the network predicted chest or abdominal x-rays with their corresponding probability percentage.

The goal of my project is to find out if I can add an image to the original dataset and run the code to see the prediction. My expectation is that if I upload an image of my dog, and configure the code to take it as an image in the test dataset, after running the code, it would show a very low pobability of one of the predictions.
